      <ul>
        <li>Git is a project-based version control system.</li>
        <li>Git projects have one central branch main with multiple feature branches for 
          amendments AKA versions.</li>
        <li>The first step to creating a local development version is to create a feature branch.</br> 
          This is the branch where we will be adding our new code.</br>
          Our default branch is called main, but master may also be seen in older repos.</br> 
          Do not code directly in the main branch. Instead, branch off of main and create 
          a feature branch, which is a copy of the main branch used to add something new to the project. 
          That way, we maintain the main branch and we can track the changes that were made to it 
          via the feature branches.</br>
        <li>A branch is a copy or version of the code that can be worked on independently in isolation 
          so development changes do not disrupt other team members who are also working on the code 
          and testing their solutions. When we are typically working on code, it is in an unstable 
          state since we are actively developing the code.</li>
        <li>It is important that amendments and updates are always worked on within feature branches before
          adhering to the main branch.</br>
          This allows for flexibility between editing versions, and ease when debugging.</li>
        <li>A pull request, or PR, is used to merge a comparison branch 
          (in our case, the feature branch) into the base branch.</li>
        <li>1. Navigate to desired directory with local repo.</br>
          2. git status to check which branch we are in. If in main branch, git checkout to create feature branch.</br>
          3. git status to confirm in new branch. looking for "working tree clean" message.</br>
          4. Edit and save file as desired.</br>
          5. git add -A to stage the changes in local repo</br>
          6. git commit -m "brief, precise, descriptive message summarizing changes"</br>
          7. git pull origin main to make sure local and main repo match, look for already up to date message</br>
          8. git push origin feature/branch-name</li>
        <li>git add -A: adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. Tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit.</li>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to said new branch.</li>

        <li><b>Control flow</b> is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. 
          In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down 
          to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
        <li>Interrupt control flow using <b>conditional statements</b> and <b>loops</b> 
          to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</br>
          <i>Interrupting the control flow allows us to build apps that respond to a user's actions.</i></li>

          if (condition) {</br>
            // block of code to be executed if condition is truthy</br>
          }</br>
          When computer encounters if statement in JS file, computer will check to see 
          if the condition is truthy. If truthy, computer will do whatever action we ask between 
          the curly brackets. If not truthy, computer will ignore instruction between curly brackets 
          and move on.</li>
          <li>Condtional statement <b>multiple if</b>:</br>
            if (first condition) {</br>
