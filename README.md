# prework-study-guide

## Description

This project was completed as a foundation for the information I will learn in the UC Berkeley full-stack web development bootcamp.

I have learned how to use my personal computer as a local workspace for building projects.
I have learned the various frameworks needed within a single project.

## Installation

## Usage

I want to use this project as an efficient way to reference new commands while I am learning and working... it will be fun to hold onto and reflect on this project as I grow into my code-based career.
Hopefully, I am able to visit this single project when looking for a variety of hints and commands rather than using a search engine. In theory, this project can become my search engine.
Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like CLI, Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
If we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. The JavaScript will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
